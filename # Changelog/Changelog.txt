# Changelog

- Defense and Resist now only come from Soul Level, not individual stats.
- Defence Scale: {1:50, 100:100, 200:150, 300:200, 400:300}
- Resist Scale: {1:50, 100:100, 200:150, 300:200, 400:300}

# Champion's Pact

 - Curse of Vulnerability: Reduces absorption by 50%.
 - Curse of Agony: Lose 10 + 0.5% HP every second.

# Weapons
- Improved the reinforcement multipliers so damage scales better into the lategame. (i.e. Max scaling went from 2 to 2.3)
- Improved the scaling multipliers for Lethal/Sharp/Blunt so they keep up with the other infusions.
- Boosted the stock multipliers to lower the gap between infusions and stock.
- Scythe of Want: increases soul absorption by 20%.
- Reverted the backstab/riposte motion values to vanilla.
- Friede's Great Scythe now deals its magic damage on its normal attacks.

# Map
- Added 16 new treasure corpses and 7 chests to Ariandel.
- Made the Pilgrim Angels slightly less accurate.
- New journey giant is now only present in Cemetery of Ash, and is on the side route at the start.

# Bugfixes

- Self-damage will no longer trigger the enemy buffs on the player from the Champion's Pact.
- Fixed Black Dragon Sword vfx/hitbox.
