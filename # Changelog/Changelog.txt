# Changelog
#------------------------------

# Stats
- Luck renamed to Humanity (HUM).

# Status Effects
- Poison and Bleed no longer scale with Luck (Humanity).
- Increased the amount of inflict for all types, in general: 30 (for quick), 50 (for normal), 80 (for slow). This is doubled for infusions on those with innate inflict.

# Catalysts
- Removed the Dark/Non-Dark catalyst mechanic.
- All catalysts now have a innate Humanity scaling, the 'dark' catalysts have more than the others.

# Spells
- All Dark spells now scale from Humanity.
- Dark spells now take INT/FTH/HUM into account. This means they max at the highest amount of damage out of all the types, but requires investment in all three to achieve this.

# Enemies
- Yhorm's flame patch lasts 15 seconds (was 8).
