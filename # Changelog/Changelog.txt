# Changelog
#------------------------------

# Stats
- Changed the levelling cost. Before 999,999,999 souls only reached level 619, now it reaches level 836.
- Luck renamed to Humanity (HUM).
- Adjusted the stats of the Heretic, Outcast and Skeptic classes

# Status Effects
- Poison and Bleed no longer scale with Luck (Humanity).
- Increased the amount of inflict for all types, in general: 30 (for quick), 50 (for normal), 80 (for slow). This is doubled for infusions on those with innate inflict.

# Catalysts
- Removed the Dark/Non-Dark catalyst mechanic.
- All 'dark' catalysts now have Humanity scaling, adding to overall spell buff. The normal INT/FTH scaling on 'dark' catalysts has been reduced, but the added HUM scaling pushes their actual spell buff above the regular catalysts. This means they are sub-optimal for normal spells, but the best for dark spells.
- Reduced the scaling on the hybrid weapons so they are set to 190 spell buff, making them mid-tier.
- Reduced the max scaling for catalysts down to 3 (from 4).

# Spells
- All Dark spells now scale from Humanity.
- Dark spells now take INT/FTH/HUM into account.
- Increased the damage of normal and dark pyromancies.

# Enemies
- Yhorm's flame patch lasts 15 seconds (was 8).
