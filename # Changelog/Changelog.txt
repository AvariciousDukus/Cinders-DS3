# Trial of Perseverance
- You may now enter the Trial of Perseverance via the sword in the alcove near to the Firelink Shrine bonfire.
- The Trial of Perseverance consists of 31 waves, which you must survive by killing enough enemies during each wave to advance to the next one.
- Each wave is unique. They are ordered by relative difficulty, so the trial starts off fairly easy and ramps up in difficulty.
- Each wave only ends once enough enemies have been killed. You can see your progress by looking at the boss HP bar that is active during a wave.
- Each wave completed will reward reinforcement material directly, the kind improving with subsequent waves.
- All enemies drop their normal drops and souls within waves, meaning you can farm them via the trial.
- Each wave completed will boost soul absorption by 25% and Item Discovery by 25, meaning you are rewarded for each wave you survive consecutively.
- Completing the full trial will unlock Primordial Forging early (Soul of Cinder still unlocks it, this is just an additional option).
