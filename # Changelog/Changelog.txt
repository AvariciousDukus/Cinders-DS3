# Changelog
#------------------------------
# General
- Added Gael's Beard and Andre's Beard to the beard selection.

# Trial of Perseverance
- You may now enter the Trial of Perseverance via the sword in the alcove near to the Firelink Shrine bonfire.
- The Trial of Perseverance consists of 31 waves, which you must survive by killing enough enemies during each wave to advance to the next one.
- Each wave is unique. They are ordered by relative difficulty, so the trial starts off fairly easy and ramps up in difficulty.
- Each wave only ends once enough enemies have been killed. You can see your progress by looking at the boss HP bar that is active during a wave.
- Each wave completed will reward reinforcement material directly, the kind improving with subsequent waves.
- All enemies drop their normal drops and souls within waves, meaning you can farm them via the trial.
- Each wave completed will boost soul absorption by 5% and Item Discovery by 25, meaning you are rewarded for each wave you survive consecutively.
- Completing the full trial will unlock Primordial Forging early (Soul of Cinder still unlocks it, this is just an additional option).

# Weapons
- Reduced the damage multipliers for the Primordial Titanite levels.
- Reduced the Bewitched Alonne Sword damage.
- Fury of Manus WA now only gives you the normal cursed back VFX.
- Crypt Blacksword WA now looks flashier.
- Obsidian Greatsword now has the Abyssal Fire WA, which is like its special attack in DS1.

# Curse
- Curse of Agony is now Curse of Vitality: Enemies brim with unholy vitality. They recover 10 + 0.05% HP every second. Boosts soul absorption by 20%.
- Curse of Gluttony now forces slow movement.
- Curse of Vulnerability now prevents estus flask usage.

# Spells
- Removed the 'ascension' mechanic for spells. Namely because it is just a 'moar power' thing, and it doesn't mesh well with pyromancies and dark spells.
- Blessed Weapon now requires 30 FTH.
- Heavenly Thunder: FP is now 80, works like the SoC's version, damage is 800 per bullet.
- Likewise with Cataclysm and Earthfall.
- Reduced Heavenly Thunder FTH requirement to 35.
- Adjusted Soul Geyser bullets.
- Lightning Storm: FP to 100
- Climax inflicts air juggle stagger normally.
- Profaned Flame has a secondary projectile normally.
- Great Farron Dart is now Scattered Farron Dart, emits a scattering of darts upon cast.
- Great Soul Arrow is now Scattered Soul Arrow, emits a scattering of soul arrows upon cast.
- Dark Edge uses farron flashsword animation normally.

# Enemies
- Added red eye VFX to nightmare bosses that support it.
- Primordial Titanite drops from NG+ ring mobs is now less than 100% on the weaker mobs.
- Reduced boss aux resists to a 150 <> 250 range, so later bosses aren't so resistant.

# Bugfixes
- King's Ultra Greatsword / Crypt Blacksword now deal Strike damage on attacks.
- Fixed Scholar's Bow not adding its effect.
- Corrected incorrect Rare Ring of Humanity summary.
- Fixed the Primordial Titanite drop rate from Dream bosses being inverted.
- Fixed bug with Crab Claw drop.
