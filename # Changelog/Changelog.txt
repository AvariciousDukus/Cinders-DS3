New illusory walls
Add secret drop points that warp you to special areas
Add a horde challenge, using generators, where you must survive for a period of time. If you do, get a reward. Probably in Midir's arena.
Add darkness to nightmare bosses (add intercept in boss start script to check for nightmare mode)
Add mimic boss
Make the re-fight items warp you to points in front of the fog door
Add respawn points for the warps where they warp you to.
