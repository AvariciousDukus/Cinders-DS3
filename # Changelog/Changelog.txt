#------------------------------
# Ideas
#------------------------------
New illusory walls
Add secret drop points that warp you to special areas
Add a horde challenge, using generators, where you must survive for a period of time. If you do, get a reward. Probably in Midir's arena.
Add darkness to nightmare bosses (add intercept in boss start script to check for nightmare mode)
Add mimic boss
Make the re-fight items warp you to points in front of the fog door
Add respawn points for the warps where they warp you to.

# Changelog
#------------------------------
# General
- Reduced the damage multipliers in NG+ for enemies.
- Removed the multipliers to the elemental defences in area/ng scaling, so split damage weapons aren't unduly reduced.
- Reduced the physical defence of enemies in the early zones significantly.
- Defense and Resist now only come from Soul Level, not individual stats.
- Defence Scale: {1:50, 100:100, 200:150, 300:200, 400:300}
- Resist Scale: {1:50, 100:100, 200:150, 300:200, 400:300}

# Weapons
- Improved the reinforcement multipliers so damage scales better into the lategame. (i.e. Max scaling went from 2 to 2.3)
- Improved the scaling multipliers for Lethal/Sharp/Blunt so they keep up with the other infusions.
- Boosted the stock multipliers to lower the gap between infusions and stock.
- Scythe of Want: increases soul absorption by 20%.

# Spells
- Sacred Oath now only boosts Physical and Lightning attack damage (+ absorption stuff).
- Lightning Arrow: damage to 200.
- Heavenly Thunder: damage to 150.

# Rings
- Greatwood Remnants: Increases physical defence by 50% but increases evasive stamina consumption by 50%.

# Map
- Added 16 new treasure corpses and 7 chests to Ariandel.
- Made the Pilgrim Angels slightly less accurate.

# Bugfixes
- Fixed a few new weapons that were missed when doing the damage/scaling for their infusions.
- Blue Flame is now correctly only Sorceries.
